# Decentralized Autonomous Intellectual Property Licensing Platform

A blockchain-based platform for managing, licensing, and monetizing intellectual property rights through NFTs and smart contracts. This system enables transparent IP ownership, automated licensing, and efficient royalty distribution while integrating with traditional IP frameworks.

## Core Features

- NFT-based IP rights representation
- Automated licensing agreements
- Fractional ownership management
- Real-time royalty distribution
- Integration with global IP databases
- Compliance with international IP laws
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

## Smart Contract Architecture

### IPTokenization.sol
Core contract for creating and managing IP NFTs.
- Patent, copyright, and trademark tokenization
- Metadata management
- Ownership verification
- IP rights transfer mechanisms

### LicensingEngine.sol
Handles licensing agreements and terms.
- License template management
- Dynamic pricing models
- Usage tracking
- Term enforcement

### RoyaltyDistribution.sol
Manages revenue sharing and payments.
- Automated royalty calculations
- Payment splitting
- Distribution schedules
- Payment history tracking

### FractionalOwnership.sol
Handles partial ownership of IP rights.
- Ownership share management
- Voting rights
- Dividend distribution
- Share transfer mechanisms

### IPRegistry.sol
Manages IP registration and verification.
- Integration with official IP databases
- Verification processes
- Status tracking
- Renewal management

## Technical Requirements

- EVM-compatible blockchain
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- Hardhat
- IPFS for document storage
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- API integration capabilities

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ip-licensing-platform

# Install dependencies
cd ip-licensing-platform
npm install

# Set up environment

## Usage Guide

### IP Tokenization

```javascript
// Example IP tokenization
const ipTokenizer = await IPTokenization.deployed();
await ipTokenizer.createIPToken(
    ipMetadata,
    rightsDescription,
    expirationDate,
    jurisdictions,
    { from: rightfulOwner }
);
```

### License Creation Process

1. Select IP token
2. Define license terms and conditions
3. Set pricing model
4. Configure royalty distribution
5. Deploy license smart contract

### Royalty Distribution Formula

```solidity
royaltyAmount = usageFee * ownershipShare * territoryMultiplier
where:
- usageFee: Base fee for IP usage
- ownershipShare: Percentage of ownership
- territoryMultiplier: Geographic market factor
```

## Integration APIs

### IP Database Integration
```javascript
// Example IP verification
async function verifyIPRights(ipId, database) {
    const registryAdapter = await IPRegistry.getAdapter(database);
    return await registryAdapter.verifyIPStatus(ipId);
}
```
